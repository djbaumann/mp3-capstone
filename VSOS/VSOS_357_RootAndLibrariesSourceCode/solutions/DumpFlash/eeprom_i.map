# VS1005g Internal FLASH example configuration file for eeprom_i.bin 2014-01-14
#
# Put all options first, before the image files.
# Each option must be on its own line.
# Options:
#   +v = Verbose; shows more detailed data when writing goes wrong.
#   -v = Not verbose (default).
#   +b = Use byte addressing; not recommended for internal memory.
#   -b = Use page addressing (default).
#   +f = VeriFy data after write (default).
#   -f = Don't veriFy data after write. Use with extreme caution!
#   +r = Write Rescue image if writing to internal eeprom (default).
#   -r = Don't write Rescue image to internal eeprom.
#        Use only if you absolutely know what you are doing! Using this
#        option incorrectly may make your VS1005 permanently inoperable!
#   !d = Dump first 1 MB of contents, don't write anything to eeprom.
#   !e = Erase 4 KiB at byte address 4096, otherwise don't write anything to
#        eeprom. If -r option is defined before !e, also remove rescue image
#        by also erasing 4 KiB at address 0 (dangerous).
#   !E = Erase whole chip, including rescue image. Use with caution.


# Then the files. The format is:
# address file.img
# where address is a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal byte address where
# to write the image file to.
#
# The following three examples all write the file eeprom.img to address 4096:
# 4096 eeprom.img
# 0x1000 eeprom.img
# 010000 eeprom.img

# Note: By default, internal flash rescue image is now automatically written
# to address 0.

# Dump contents
!d
