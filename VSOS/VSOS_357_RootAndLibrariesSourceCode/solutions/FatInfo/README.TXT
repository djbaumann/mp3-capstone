FatInfo gives information on a FAT32 formatted device. While far from
complete, the information may still be useful.




The VSOS Shell command line options are:

Usage: FatInfo x: [blkNum] [-v|+v|-h]
x:      Drive name
blkNum  Print contents of block number
-v|+v   Verbose on/off
-h      Show this help
