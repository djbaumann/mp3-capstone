# VS1005g External FLASH example configuration file for eeprom_i.bin 2014-01-14
#
# Put all options first, before the image files.
# Each option must be on its own line.
# Options:
#   +v = Verbose; shows more detailed data when writing goes wrong.
#   -v = Not verbose (default).
#   +b = Use byte addressing; use for memories with broken auto-increment
#        like SST25VF016B. This mode may be very slow, so it is not
#        recommended for use with other memory ICs.
#   -b = Use page addressing (default).
#   +f = VeriFy data after write (default).
#   -f = Don't veriFy data after write. Use with extreme caution!
#   !d = Dump first 2 MB of contents, don't write anything to eeprom.
#   !e = Erase 4 KiB at address 0, otherwise don't write anything to eeprom.


# Then the files. The format is:
# address file.img
# where address is a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal byte address where
# to write the image file to.
#
# The following three examples all write the file eeprom.img to address 4096:
# 4096 eeprom.img
# 0x1000 eeprom.img
# 010000 eeprom.img
0 eeprom.img
