This is a simpified example replacement driver for DECWAV.DL3. The difference
with this driver is that it only decodes 8-, 16-, 24-, or 32-bit PCM,
or 32-bit floating point WAV files, whereas the closed source default
driver can also decode 4-bit IMA ADPCM as well as 8-bit u-Law and aLaw. This
is intended as a reference of how to create your own audio decoder.

By compiling this package, you will get a replaments version of DECWAV.DL3,
which you can copy into your S:SYS/ directory.
