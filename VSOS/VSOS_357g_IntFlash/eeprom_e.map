# VS1005g External FLASH example configuration file for eeprom_i.bin 2016-07-20
#
# Put all options first, before the image files.
# Each option must be on its own line.
# Options:
#   +v = Verbose; shows more detailed data when writing goes wrong.
#   -v = Not verbose (default).
#   +b = Use byte addressing; use for memories with broken auto-increment
#        like SST25VF016B. This mode may be very slow, so it is not
#        recommended for use with other memory ICs.
#   -b = Use page addressing (default).
#   +f = VeriFy data after write (default).
#   -f = Don't veriFy data after write. Use with extreme caution!
#   +s0 = Set SPI speed  0.5 Mbit/s (default)
#   +s1 = Set SPI speed  1.0 Mbit/s
#   +s2 = Set SPI speed  2.0 Mbit/s
#   +s3 = Set SPI speed  3.3 Mbit/s
#   +s4 = Set SPI speed  5.0 Mbit/s
#   +s5 = Set SPI speed  6.6 Mbit/s
#   +s6 = Set SPI speed 10.0 Mbit/s
#   +s7 = Set SPI speed 13.3 Mbit/s
#   +s8 = Set SPI speed 20.0 Mbit/s
#   +s9 = Set SPI speed 39.9 Mbit/s
#   !d = Dump first 2 MiB of contents, stop execution.
#   !dx = Dump first x MiB of contents, stop execution.
#   !e = Erase 4 KiB at address 0, stop execution.
#   !ec = Attempt to erase whole chip, stop execution.
#   !EC = Attempt to erase whole chip.
#   !t = Test write speed by erasing, then writing random data to first 1 MiB.
#   !c  = Calculate CRC32 checksum of first 2 MiB of FLASH contents, then stop.
#   !cx = Calculate CRC32 checksum of first x MiB of FLASH contents, then stop.
#   !C  = Calculate CRC32 checksum of first 2 MiB of FLASH contents.
#   !Cx = Calculate CRC32 checksum of first x MiB of FLASH contents.
#   !R  = Reset chip
+s6

# Then the files. The format is:
# address file.img
# where address is a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal byte address where
# to write the image file to.
#
# The following three examples all write the file eeprom.img to address 4096:
# 4096 eeprom.img
# 0x1000 eeprom.img
# 010000 eeprom.img

#Empty image
#0 eeprom.img_empty

#VSOS to external flash
0 eeprom_e.img

# Default if eeprom_e.map didn't exist
#0 eeprom.img

#reset chip
!R
