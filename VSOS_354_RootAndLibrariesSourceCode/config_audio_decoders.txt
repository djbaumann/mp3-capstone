# VSOS3 Boot Configuration File optimized for maximum quality audio
# Hi-Res format playback.
#
# Please connect UART:115200,N81 to see the boot information.
# At the boot time, STDOUT and STDERR will print to the UART.
#
# At boot, you can press [S1], [S2], [S1+S2] or [S4] to select configuration
# 1, 2, 5, or 4, respectively.

[1]
# Button[S1] pressed.
# Configuration S1 is fixed to be the USB Upload Configuration 
# in the Kernel. [S1] for SPI Flash (System disk)
# For usability reasons, the chip will remain in the USB mode until
# it is reset, so no further drivers can be loaded in this configuration.



[2]
# Button [S2] pressed during boot.
# Just wait "forever" for a potential VS3EMU connection attempt
run delay 0x7fffffff



[3]
# Configuration S3 cannot be used due to a power issue with the developer
# board PCB.



[4]
# Button [S4] pressed during boot.
# Just wait "forever" for a potential VS3EMU connection attempt
run delay 0x7fffffff



[5]
# Buttons [S1] and [S2] pressed simultaneously during boot.
# In this configuration, the OS loads drivers and *then* shows S: on USB.
# For this example we load the SD driver to be shown on the USB.
