# VSOS3 Boot Configuration File
# Please connect UART:115200,N81 to see the boot information.
# At the boot time, STDOUT and STDERR will print to the UART.
# Later, when a CONSOLE driver is loaded, STDOUT will go to that console.

# At boot, you can press [S1], [S2], [S1+S2] or [S4] to select a configuration.
